Here's delve clicker.For now this is a cmd game. It's the first version of the game that I`ve published. Later, when all options will be finished I am going to port this to GUI interface. But athe moment this is the first 0.1 version. You may play it on your cmd if you launch it. In case you find any bug, fix it, or just inform me about it. I will be grateful to you.

Big thank you!

in V0.1 you can:

SHOP->Instruments

Buy itstruments such as Rock, Pickaxe and Power pickaxe in the shop. Due to these instruments you can increase your mining power. Increasing the power allows to raise the amount of loot from mining.

SHOP-> Delve Instruments

Buy delve instruments such as Shovel. With the help of the shovel you can get to new delves and obtain more loot from mining.

You can mine in Go to Mine->Start Mining. Currently mining is too fast by the reason of the game is in test .Later it will be x20 from current speed. Take a new delve in Go to Mine->Go to next delve. For every delve you need 5 shovel and 10 gold at the moment. During the further development of the game the prices of every delve will be changed.

You can earn gold with selling your stones and coal in "Go to trader"
